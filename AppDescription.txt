A simple, lightweight, minimalistic, and easy to use app to track calories and macros.

The app allows serious individuals to precisely track calories, fats, carbs, and proteins.  It doesn't connect to the internet to obtain over generalized nutrition information to encourage users to create a personalized database of the foods they commonly consumed by checking the food labels on food packages, because not all foods are created the same.

The app can export and import the user database for backups, set macro targets, and view historical data in the calendar.

There are no ads and doesn't collect any private user information.
